## World ambience

Plays ambient sound according to features of the world around the player.

The ambient sounds can be controlled via the following settings:

- **Volume scaling** affects the volume of all situational ambient sounds.
- **Above ground for ambience silencing** is the number of blocks above the ground that biome ambience will be silenced.
- **Cave drone cutoff** is the height at which cave drones will be silenced.
- **Cave light level** is the light level at which cave ambience will be dampened.
- **Valid cave ambience dimensions** is a list of dimensions in which cave drones will be played. By default this is the overworld.

The world ambience contains:

- sounds while anywhere in the End.

- drone sound when in a cave below the cave drone cutoff.
