## Biome ambience

Plays ambient background sound according to the biome and time of day.

The ambient sounds can be controlled via the following settings:

- **Above ground for ambience silencing** is the number of blocks above the ground that biome ambience will be silenced.
- **Biome sound blending** is the number of blocks to check for neighbouring biomes.
- **Volume scaling** affects the volume of all biome ambient sounds.
- **Valid dimensions** is a list of dimensions in which biome ambience will be played. By default this is the overworld and The End.
