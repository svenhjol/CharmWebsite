**Charmony** is a collection of ~~forever work in progress~~ Minecraft mods that focus on **vanilla** and **vanilla+** gameplay. These mods use the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) loader and depend on [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/).

There are currently three mods, each with their own theme:

- [Charm](CHARM_FEATURES_URL) adds over 70 small tweaks, quality of life improvements and features that keep the theme of the vanilla game without changing core gameplay. All **Charm** features are able to be turned on and off using the extensive configuration file. Some features that do change gameplay are disabled by default.
- [Charmonium](CHARMONIUM_FEATURES_URL) is a **client-only** mod that adds ambient sound effects based on the biome, time of day and nearby features. It **does not** require Charm to be present to play. As it is client-only, it may be used with vanilla servers such as Realms.
- [Strange](STRANGE_FEATURES_URL) is a vanilla+ mod that adds some features that encourage travel and exploration. It **requires** Charm to be present to play.
