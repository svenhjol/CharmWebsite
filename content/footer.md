**Charmony** is made possible by the support of wonderful people, in particular **Coranthes** for graphic design and **WarlordWossman** + **ridjack** for game design and dimissing/refining my terrible ideas.

All sounds used in-game are recorded by myself, downloaded from [Freesound](https://freesound.org) or taken from the [MAtmos](https://modrinth.com/mod/matmos) mod.
