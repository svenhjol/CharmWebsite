## Runestones

Runestones are blocks that teleport players to interesting structures and biomes.

Each runestone will show what item is needed as a sacrifice when the player looks at the block. Drop the item near the runestone to activate it. Once the runestone is activated, throw an enderpearl at it to teleport.

In survival mode, runestones are found on the top of [Stone circle](STRANGE_FEATURES_URL#stone_circles) pillars.
