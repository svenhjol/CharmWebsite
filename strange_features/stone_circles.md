## Stone circles

Adds small pillars of stone in all three dimensions. Stone circles tend to be found in reasonably flat, tree-less terrain in the overworld. In the Nether they can be found at any height or partly submerged in a lava lake. In the End, obsidian stone circles appear on the outer islands.

[Runestones](STRANGE_FEATURES_URL#runestones) can be found on top of the stone pillars.
