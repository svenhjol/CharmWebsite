## Travel journals

Travel journals are craftable items to store photos and descriptions of interesting places in the world. To craft one, use a book and a compass in a shapeless recipe.

Each journal contains bookmarked locations. Locations can be saved to pages and added to another journal, or given to other players to add to their journal.

Press the bookmark key (defaults to B) with a journal in your inventory to add a new bookmark.
