## Piglin pointing

Piglins turn and point in the rough direction of a nether fortress or bastion remnant.

By default, give them a chiseled nether brick block for a fortress and a gilded blackstone block for a bastion.

The item tags `piglin_barters_for_bastions` and `piglin_barters_for_fortresses` can be used to configure the blocks.
