## Totem of preserving

Preserves your items on death. You must be holding a totem of preserving to preserve your items.

Use (right-click) the totem to retrieve your items. A single totem can only be used a certain number of times, but it can be repaired using **echo shards**.

This feature has a configuration called **Grave mode** whereby a totem of preserving will always be created when you die.
